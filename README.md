# Compasso UOL Challenge
Challenge provided by Compasso UOL to a front-end developer job vacancy


This project contains the following module:
 - client (ReactJS)
    A system that simulates a login page with countdown to expire the session after user being logged. The most focus of this implementation was reproduce exactly the layout proposed at Figma. The initial figma flow doesn't include a Mobile UI but, in this project it was created to a study case.

### ⚙ Instalation

As a React project, the installation is very simple. To run this project locally, you just need to install the dependencies and start to see the magic. ✨

I recommend using yarn as your package manager. Just run the following lines:

``` javascript
yarn
yarn start
```

It will run the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.
